# Consumer Theory

Utility functions represent preferences. Budget constraints limit choices. 
The optimal bundle occurs where the highest indifference curve touches the budget line.

## Preferences and Indifference Curves
Completeness, transitivity, and monotonicity define rational preferences.

## Budget Constraints
Income and prices determine the feasible set of choices.
